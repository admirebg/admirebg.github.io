<br>
The 'P.S' suggests the collaborative interaction system that gathers peopleâ€™s normal voices and transforms them into a real-time generative artwork.
<br>
The elastic interface and the way of interaction make participants connected to the concept of the work. By digging the surface which is similar to finding or accessing something, a participant can hear and share the heartstrings.
