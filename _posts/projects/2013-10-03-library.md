Recently library with multimedia environment not only facilitates the usage of library, but transforms it to the digital space that a user can participate in and interact with as well. 
<br>
From this perspective, a service needs to be supported which affords user-centered interaction, not those limited usage.
<br>
This study suggests prototype development process to improve the way of searching and reaching at destination to reflect user"s demand based on contextual design approach. The process of development specifically contains method of from collecting data, analyzing results, evaluating it and inducing an ultimate interaction service.
<br>
Also, the study has the significance in suggesting a mobile service design for library usage, which makes both user-centered interaction and technical support possible, and a prototype development process.
